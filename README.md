HeaderBar widget exeample (gtkmm 3)
-----------------------------------

This is a little program that demonstrates the use of the [HeaderBar](https://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm/stable/classGtk_1_1HeaderBar.html) widget from the [gtkmm 3 library](http://www.gtkmm.org/en/).  

The [great tutorials provided by the Gnome Developer Website](http://developer.gnome.org/gtkmm-tutorial/unstable/index.html) didn't include any form of help on how to use this widget so I decided to find out myself.   

This test program is inspired by the [Python Gtk3 Tutorial for the Stack Widget](http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/layout.html#id4).
